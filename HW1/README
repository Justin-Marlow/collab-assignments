Description:
This program implements a Vector class to provide an automatically resizeable dynamic array with similiar operations to the std::vector.

How to Compile: "make" will utlize the provided Makefile
How to Run: "./test"
How to Clean and Recompile:  "make clean && make"

Tests to Verify Functionality:

Test 1: Default constructor
     - Creates a new object from the Vector class, 'v'.
     - Displayed size and capacity to ensure they are set to 0.
     
Test 2: push_back(), size(), capacity(), and operator[]
     -Creates a new Vector 'v'
     - Used a for loop and push_back to place 10 integers into the Vector
     - Used size() and capacity() to display the size and capacity after filling the Vector
     - Used a for loop and '[]' to display values at each index
     
Test 3: Copy constructor
     - Created Vector 'v1' and filled with 10 integers
     - Created Vector 'v2' by copying 'v1'
     - Modified 'v2' to verify deep copy
     - Displayed size and last element comparisons

Test 4: Assignment Operator
     - Created Vector 'v1' and filled with 10 integers
     - Created an empty Vector 'v2' then used the assignment operator to copy all elements
     - Modified 'v2' to verify deep copy
     - Displayed size and last element comparisons

Test 5: Reserve Capacity
     - Created a new Vector 'v'
     - Set reserve capacity to 500
     - Displayed current capacity

Test 6: Large Insertion Test (1000 elements)
     - Created a new Vector 'v'
     - Used a for loop and push_back to insert 1000 integers
     - Displayed final size and capacity

Destructor tested throughout, confirmed by destructor statement.
